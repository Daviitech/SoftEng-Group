Mission:  “Pushing Docker and HTML File to GitHub” 

Objective: The goal of this task was to successfully upload a Docker container and an HTML file to my GitHub repository. This was aimed at demonstrating my ability to work with Docker and version control systems. 

Process: 

Docker Container Setup:  

I started by setting up the Docker container.  

Base Image: Choose a base image suitable for your project (e.g., FROM python:3.8). 

Copy Files: Use COPY to add project files into the Docker container. 

Install Dependencies: Use RUN for installing necessary dependencies. 

Set Environment: Define working directory (WORKDIR), environment variables (ENV), and expose ports (EXPOSE). 

Run Command: Specify the command to run your application (CMD). 

Build and Test: Build the Docker image and test it locally. 

Documentation: Document setup and usage instructions.. 

HTML File Development: 

 I created an HTML file. 

Pushing to GitHub: 

I initialized my local repository using git init. 

I added the Docker and HTML files to the repository using git add. 

I committed the changes with a descriptive message using git commit -m "Added Docker and HTML files". 

Finally, I pushed the changes to my GitHub repository using git push. 

Challenges and Solutions: 

Difficulty in setting up the Docker environment correctly. For instance, issues with the Dockerfile syntax or configuring Docker to work seamlessly on your local machine. 

Encountered problems with serving the HTML file using the Docker container, such as the HTML file not displaying correctly when accessed through the container. 

Results and Learning:  

The files were successfully pushed to GitHub.
